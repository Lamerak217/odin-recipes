<h3>Description</h3>
<p>A very light and fluffy pancake recipe that requires fresh buttermilk, but it's the best I've ever made!</p>

<ul>
    <li>flour</li>
    <li>leaveners</li>
    <li>salt</li>
    <li>buttermilk</li>
    <li>eggs</li>
    <li>butter</li>
</ul>
<h3>Steps</h3>
<ol>
    <li><b>Mix the dry ingredients</b>: Combine flour, sugar, baking powder, baking soda, and salt in a large bowl.</li>
    <li><b>Mix the wet ingredients</b>: Beat the buttermilk, milk, eggs, and melted butter together in a separate bowl. Do not combine the wet and dry ingredients until right before you cook the pancakes</li>
    <li><b>Make the pancakes</b>: Add the wet ingredients to the dry ingredients and mix with a wooden spoon or fork until the mixtures are just-blended. Scoop the batter onto a hot, oiled griddle and cook until the pancake is bubbly on the top. Flip with a spatula and cook until both sides are brown.</li>
